    "Sure, I will provide more detailed explanations, include real-life use cases, and present creative solutions to each question. Let's go through them step-by-step:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Difference between a function and a method in Python:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Function:** \n",
    "     A function is a block of reusable code that is independent of any object and can be called with zero or more arguments. Functions can perform operations, return results, and be used in various parts of a program. For example, a function to calculate the factorial of a number:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def factorial(n):\n",
    "         if n == 0:\n",
    "             return 1\n",
    "         else:\n",
    "             return n * factorial(n-1)\n",
    "     print(factorial(5))  # Outputs 120\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Method:**\n",
    "     A method is similar to a function but is associated with an object. It can access and modify the object's state. Methods are defined within a class. For instance, consider a `Circle` class with a method to calculate its area:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import math\n",
    "\n",
    "     class Circle:\n",
    "         def __init__(self, radius):\n",
    "             self.radius = radius\n",
    "\n",
    "         def area(self):\n",
    "             return math.pi * (self.radius ** 2)\n",
    "     \n",
    "     circle = Circle(5)\n",
    "     print(circle.area())  # Outputs 78.53981633974483\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Function arguments and parameters in Python:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Parameters:** Variables listed inside the parentheses in the function definition. They act as placeholders for the values that will be passed to the function.\n",
    "   - **Arguments:** Actual values that are passed to the function when it is called.\n",
    "   \n",
    "     Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def greet(name):  # 'name' is a parameter\n",
    "         return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "     print(greet(\"Alice\"))  # 'Alice' is an argument\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Real-life analogy:** Consider a coffee machine (function). The machine has a slot for inserting coins (parameters). When you insert a coin (argument), the machine dispenses coffee.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Different ways to define and call a function in Python:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Standard function definition:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def multiply(x, y):\n",
    "         return x * y\n",
    "     print(multiply(2, 3))  # Outputs 6\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     **Use case:** Multiplying two numbers provided by a user in a calculator application.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Lambda function:** A small anonymous function defined using the `lambda` keyword, often used for short-term operations.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     multiply = lambda x, y: x * y\n",
    "     print(multiply(2, 3))  # Outputs 6\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     **Use case:** Sorting a list of dictionaries by a specific key value.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     products = [{'name': 'apple', 'price': 10}, {'name': 'banana', 'price': 5}]\n",
    "     sorted_products = sorted(products, key=lambda x: x['price'])\n",
    "     print(sorted_products)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   The `return` statement terminates the function execution and optionally sends back a value to the caller. It is essential for retrieving the result of a function's computation.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def square(x):\n",
    "       return x * x\n",
    "   result = square(4)\n",
    "   print(result)  # Outputs 16\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   **Creative example:** A vending machine function where the return statement represents the item being dispensed.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def dispense_item(code):\n",
    "       items = {'A1': 'Soda', 'B2': 'Chips', 'C3': 'Candy'}\n",
    "       return items.get(code, 'Invalid code')\n",
    "   print(dispense_item('B2'))  # Outputs 'Chips'\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Iterators in Python and how they differ from iterables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Iterable:** An object capable of returning its members one at a time. Examples include lists, tuples, and strings. Any object with an `__iter__()` method is iterable.\n",
    "   - **Iterator:** An object that represents a stream of data; it implements the `__next__()` method to fetch the next item. Created using the `iter()` function.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "     my_iterator = iter(my_list)\n",
    "     print(next(my_iterator))  # Outputs 1\n",
    "     print(next(my_iterator))  # Outputs 2\n",
    "     print(next(my_iterator))  # Outputs 3\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     **Real-life analogy:** A playlist (iterable) where you can go to the next song using a \"next\" button (iterator).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Generators in Python and how they are defined:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Generators are special iterators that allow you to declare a function that behaves like an iterator. They are defined using the `yield` keyword and provide a convenient way to implement lazy evaluation.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def countdown(n):\n",
    "       while n > 0:\n",
    "           yield n\n",
    "           n -= 1\n",
    "\n",
    "   for number in countdown(5):\n",
    "       print(number)  # Outputs 5 4 3 2 1\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   **Creative use case:** Simulating a traffic light sequence.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def traffic_light():\n",
    "       while True:\n",
    "           yield 'Red'\n",
    "           yield 'Green'\n",
    "           yield 'Yellow'\n",
    "\n",
    "   light = traffic_light()\n",
    "   for _ in range(6):\n",
    "       print(next(light))  # Outputs Red Green Yellow Red Green Yellow\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Advantages of using generators over regular functions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Memory Efficiency:** Generators produce items one at a time and only when needed, which is more memory efficient than storing the entire sequence in memory.\n",
    "   - **Lazy Evaluation:** Values are generated on-the-fly, allowing for handling of large data sets or infinite sequences.\n",
    "   - **Improved Performance:** Generators can be faster for certain tasks due to reduced memory usage and immediate computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example:** Reading a large file line by line without loading the entire file into memory.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def read_large_file(file_path):\n",
    "       with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n",
    "           for line in file:\n",
    "               yield line.strip()\n",
    "   \n",
    "   for line in read_large_file('large_file.txt'):\n",
    "       print(line)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Lambda function in Python and when it is typically used:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   A lambda function is a small anonymous function defined with the `lambda` keyword. It is used for creating small, one-off functions, typically for short-term use.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   add = lambda x, y: x + y\n",
    "   print(add(5, 3))  # Outputs 8\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   **Creative example:** Filtering a list of names based on a condition.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   names = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\", \"David\"]\n",
    "   filtered_names = filter(lambda name: len(name) <= 4, names)\n",
    "   print(list(filtered_names))  # Outputs ['Bob']\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   The `map()` function applies a given function to all items in an iterable (like a list) and returns a map object (an iterator).\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "   squares = map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers)\n",
    "   print(list(squares))  # Outputs [1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   **Use case:** Converting a list of temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   celsius = [0, 20, 30, 100]\n",
    "   fahrenheit = map(lambda c: (c * 9/5) + 32, celsius)\n",
    "   print(list(fahrenheit))  # Outputs [32.0, 68.0, 86.0, 212.0]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **`map()`:** Applies a function to all items in an iterable and returns a map object.\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "      squares = map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers)\n",
    "      print(list(squares))  # Outputs [1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **`reduce()`:** Applies a rolling computation to sequential pairs of values in an iterable. It is part of the `functools` module.\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      from functools import reduce\n",
    "      numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "      product = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, numbers)\n",
    "      print(product)  # Outputs 24\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **`filter()`:** Filters items out of an iterable based on a function that returns True or False.\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "      evens = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)\n",
    "      print(list(evens))  # Outputs [2, 4]\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Internal mechanism for sum operation using reduce function on the list `[47,11,42,13]`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    (Attach a scanned image or drawing of this)\n",
    "    Here is a step-by-step process of how `reduce` works with the sum operation:\n",
    "    - Initial list: `[47, 11, 42, 13]`\n",
    "    - Initial call: `47 + 11 = 58`\n",
    "    - Next call: `58 + 42 = \n",
    "\n",
    "100`\n",
    "    - Final call: `100 + 13 = 113`\n",
    "    The final result is `113`.\n",
    "\n",
