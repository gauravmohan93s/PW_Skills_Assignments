    "\n",
    "#### **1. Explain the different types of data (qualitative and quantitative) and provide examples of each. Discuss nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Qualitative Data (Categorical Data):**\n",
    "  - **Nominal Scale:** Data is categorized without any order or ranking.\n",
    "    - Example: Gender (Male, Female), Blood Type (A, B, AB, O).\n",
    "  - **Ordinal Scale:** Data is categorized with a specific order or ranking.\n",
    "    - Example: Education Level (High School, Bachelor’s, Master’s, PhD), Customer Satisfaction (Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quantitative Data (Numerical Data):**\n",
    "  - **Interval Scale:** Data has a specific order, and the difference between values is meaningful, but there is no true zero point.\n",
    "    - Example: Temperature in Celsius (20°C, 30°C), IQ Scores.\n",
    "  - **Ratio Scale:** Data has a specific order, the difference between values is meaningful, and there is a true zero point.\n",
    "    - Example: Height (0 cm, 150 cm, 180 cm), Weight (0 kg, 50 kg, 100 kg).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. What are the measures of central tendency, and when should you use each? Discuss the mean, median, and mode with examples and situations where each is appropriate.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mean:** The average of all data points. It is sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "  - Example: The mean of `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11]` is `(2+3+5+7+11)/5 = 5.6`.\n",
    "  - Use when data is symmetrically distributed without outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Median:** The middle value when data is ordered. It is not affected by outliers.\n",
    "  - Example: The median of `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11]` is `5`.\n",
    "  - Use when data is skewed or has outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mode:** The most frequently occurring value in the dataset.\n",
    "  - Example: The mode of `[2, 3, 3, 5, 7]` is `3`.\n",
    "  - Use for categorical data or when identifying the most common value.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Explain the concept of dispersion. How do variance and standard deviation measure the spread of data?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dispersion** refers to how spread out the data points are in a dataset.\n",
    "- **Variance (σ²):** Measures the average squared deviation from the mean.\n",
    "  - Formula: \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    σ² = Σ(xᵢ - μ)² / N\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - Example: For `[2, 4, 6]`, the mean is `4`. Variance = `[(2-4)² + (4-4)² + (6-4)²]/3 = 2.67`.\n",
    "- **Standard Deviation (σ):** The square root of variance, providing a measure of spread in the same units as the data.\n",
    "  - Example: Standard deviation = `√2.67 ≈ 1.63`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. What is a box plot, and what can it tell you about the distribution of data?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **box plot** is a graphical representation of data that shows the distribution based on a five-number summary: minimum, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and maximum.\n",
    "- It can tell you:\n",
    "  - The **median** (middle line).\n",
    "  - The **interquartile range (IQR)** (Q3 - Q1).\n",
    "  - **Outliers** (points outside `1.5 * IQR` from Q1 or Q3).\n",
    "  - The **skewness** of the data (if the box is not symmetric).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Discuss the role of random sampling in making inferences about populations.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Random sampling** ensures that every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected, reducing bias.\n",
    "- It allows us to make **inferences** about the population based on sample data.\n",
    "- Example: If you randomly sample 100 students from a school to estimate the average height, the sample mean can be used to estimate the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6. Explain the concept of skewness and its types. How does skewness affect the interpretation of data?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Skewness** measures the asymmetry of the data distribution.\n",
    "  - **Positive Skew:** The tail on the right side is longer. Mean > Median.\n",
    "    - Example: Income distribution (few high-income individuals).\n",
    "  - **Negative Skew:** The tail on the left side is longer. Mean < Median.\n",
    "    - Example: Age at retirement (most retire around the same age, few retire early).\n",
    "- Skewness affects the interpretation of data by influencing the mean and median. In skewed data, the median is often a better measure of central tendency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **7. What is the interquartile range (IQR), and how is it used to detect outliers?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **IQR** is the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3): `IQR = Q3 - Q1`.\n",
    "- **Outliers** are data points that fall below `Q1 - 1.5 * IQR` or above `Q3 + 1.5 * IQR`.\n",
    "  - Example: For data `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, Q1 = 3, Q3 = 8, IQR = 5. Outliers are below `3 - 7.5 = -4.5` or above `8 + 7.5 = 15.5`. No outliers in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **8. Discuss the conditions under which the binomial distribution is used.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **binomial distribution** is used when:\n",
    "  1. There are a fixed number of trials (n).\n",
    "  2. Each trial has only two outcomes: success or failure.\n",
    "  3. The probability of success (p) is constant for each trial.\n",
    "  4. Trials are independent.\n",
    "- Example: Tossing a coin 10 times and counting the number of heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **9. Explain the properties of the normal distribution and the empirical rule (68-95-99.7 rule).**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normal Distribution:**\n",
    "  - Symmetric, bell-shaped curve.\n",
    "  - Mean = Median = Mode.\n",
    "  - Defined by mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ).\n",
    "- **Empirical Rule:**\n",
    "  - 68% of data falls within `±1σ` of the mean.\n",
    "  - 95% of data falls within `±2σ` of the mean.\n",
    "  - 99.7% of data falls within `±3σ` of the mean.\n",
    "  - Example: If mean = 100, σ = 15, then 68% of data falls between 85 and 115.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **10. Provide a real-life example of a Poisson process and calculate the probability for a specific event.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Poisson Process:** Models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.\n",
    "  - Example: Number of emails received in an hour.\n",
    "  - Formula: \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    P(X = k) = (λᵏ * e^(-λ)) / k!\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    where λ is the average rate.\n",
    "  - Example Calculation: If λ = 5 emails/hour, the probability of receiving exactly 3 emails is:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    P(X = 3) = (5³ * e^(-5)) / 3! = (125 * 0.0067) / 6 ≈ 0.1404.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **11. Explain what a random variable is and differentiate between discrete and continuous random variables.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Random Variable:** A variable whose possible values are outcomes of a random phenomenon.\n",
    "  - **Discrete Random Variable:** Takes on a countable number of distinct values.\n",
    "    - Example: Number of heads in 10 coin tosses.\n",
    "  - **Continuous Random Variable:** Takes on an infinite number of possible values within a range.\n",
    "    - Example: Height of students in a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **12. Provide an example dataset, calculate both covariance and correlation, and interpret the results.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example Dataset:**\n",
    "  - X = `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`\n",
    "  - Y = `[2, 4, 5, 4, 5]`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Covariance:**\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Cov(X, Y) = Σ(xᵢ - x̄)(yᵢ - ȳ) / n\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  - Calculation:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Cov(X, Y) = [(1-3)(2-4) + (2-3)(4-4) + ...] / 5 = 1.0\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - Interpretation: Positive covariance indicates that X and Y tend to move in the same direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Correlation:**\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  r = Cov(X, Y) / (σₓ * σᵧ)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  - Calculation:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    r = 1.0 / (1.58 * 1.14) ≈ 0.55\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - Interpretation: A correlation of 0.55 indicates a moderate positive relationship between X and Y.\n",
