    "**Question 1: Z-statistic and Standard Normal Distribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The z-statistic (or z-score) measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean in a standard normal distribution. It's calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "z = (X - μ) / σ\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* X is the data point\n",
    "* μ is the population mean\n",
    "* σ is the population standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relationship:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The z-statistic transforms any normal distribution into the standard normal distribution, which has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This allows us to easily calculate probabilities and compare data points from different normal distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis Testing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In hypothesis testing, the z-statistic is used to determine how likely it is to obtain a sample mean if the null hypothesis is true. A large z-statistic (in absolute value) indicates that the sample mean is far from the hypothesized population mean, leading to rejection of the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a group of students has an average height of 170 cm with a standard deviation of 10 cm. If a student has a height of 185 cm, the z-statistic is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "z = (185 - 170) / 10 = 1.5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the student's height is 1.5 standard deviations above the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2: P-value in Hypothesis Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The p-value is the probability of obtaining results as extreme as the observed results of a statistical hypothesis test assuming that the null hypothesis is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use in Hypothesis Testing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In hypothesis testing, the p-value is compared to the significance level (alpha). If the p-value is less than alpha, the null hypothesis is rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A very small p-value (e.g., 0.01) means there is strong evidence against the null hypothesis. It suggests that the observed results are unlikely to have occurred by chance alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we are testing whether a coin is biased. We flip the coin 100 times and observe 60 heads. The p-value is the probability of observing 60 or more heads in 100 flips if the coin is fair. If the p-value is 0.02, it means there is a 2% chance of observing 60 or more heads by chance alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 3: Binomial and Bernoulli Distributions**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bernoulli Distribution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bernoulli distribution models a single trial with two possible outcomes: success (usually denoted as 1) or failure (usually denoted as 0). It has one parameter, p, which is the probability of success.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Binomial Distribution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials. It has two parameters: n, the number of trials, and p, the probability of success in each trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparison:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bernoulli distribution is a special case of the binomial distribution with n = 1. The binomial distribution describes the number of successes in multiple trials, while the Bernoulli distribution describes the outcome of a single trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bernoulli: Flipping a coin once (success = heads, failure = tails)\n",
    "* Binomial: Flipping a coin 10 times and counting the number of heads\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 4: Conditions for Binomial Distribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conditions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The binomial distribution is used when the following conditions are met:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The number of trials is fixed.\n",
    "* Each trial is independent.\n",
    "* There are only two possible outcomes (success or failure).\n",
    "* The probability of success is constant for each trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relationship with Bernoulli:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The binomial distribution is based on the Bernoulli distribution. It models the number of successes in a series of Bernoulli trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a basketball player has a free throw success rate of 70%. The number of successful free throws in 10 attempts follows a binomial distribution with n = 10 and p = 0.7.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 5: Poisson Distribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Properties:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Poisson distribution models the number of events that occur in a fixed interval of time or space. It has one parameter, λ, which is the average number of events in the interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conditions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Poisson distribution is used when the following conditions are met:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Events occur randomly and independently.\n",
    "* The average number of events is constant.\n",
    "* Events can occur multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of phone calls received by a call center in an hour follows a Poisson distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 6: Probability Distribution and Probability Density Function (PDF)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probability Distribution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A probability distribution describes the likelihood of all possible outcomes of a random variable. It can be discrete or continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probability Density Function (PDF):**\n",
    "\n",
    "A PDF is a function that describes the relative likelihood of a continuous random variable taking on a given value. The area under the PDF curve over an interval represents the probability of the random variable falling within that interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probability Mass Function (PMF):**\n",
    "\n",
    "A PMF is a function that describes the probability of a discrete random variable taking on a given value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difference:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A PDF is used for continuous random variables, while a PMF is used for discrete random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* PDF: The height of a person\n",
    "* PMF: The number of heads in 10 coin flips\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 7: Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statement:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that the distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we repeatedly take samples of size 30 from a population and calculate the sample mean. The distribution of these sample means will be approximately normal, even if the population distribution is not normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 8: Z-scores and T-scores**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Z-scores:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Z-scores are used when the population standard deviation is known or when the sample size is large (n > 30).\n",
    "\n",
    "**T-scores:**\n",
    "\n",
    "T-scores are used when the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is small (n < 30).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Z-score: Testing the average height of a population when the population standard deviation is known.\n",
    "* T-score: Testing the average height of a small sample of students when the population standard deviation is unknown."
